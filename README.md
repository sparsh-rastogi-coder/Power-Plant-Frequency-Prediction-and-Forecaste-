# Power-Plant-Frequency-Prediction-and-Forecaste-
I have developed a model to predict and forecast a power plant's operating frequency using time series analysis. The project integrates ARIMA for statistical forecasting and LSTM for capturing complex patterns, improving prediction accuracy and aiding in better operational decisions for the power plant.
